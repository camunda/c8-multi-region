    ## WARNING: In order to get your multi-region setup covered by Camunda enterprise support
    # you MUST get your configuration and run books reviewed by Camunda before going to production.
    # This is necessary for us to be able to help you in case of outages,
    # due to the complexity of operating multi-region setups and the dependencies to the underlying Kubernetes prerequisites.
    # If you operate this in the wrong way you risk corruption and complete loss of all data especially in the dual-region case.
    # If you can, consider three regions. Please, contact your customer success manager as soon as you start planning a multi-region setup.
    # Camunda reserves the right to limit support if no review was done prior to launch or the review showed significant risks.
